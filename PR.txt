How git pull works under the hood.
    
    Under the hood git pull is actually running two separate commands:
    git fetch which checks for any changes in the remote since the last fetch,
    and either git merge or git rebase , depending on how the command is configured,
    which then merges/rebases these changes into your local branch.
